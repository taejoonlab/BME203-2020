## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
varplot<-read_tsv('variabliltytableSwindow10.txt')
varplot
p<-ggplot(data=varplot,aes(x=Nucleotide_position, y=Variability_score, group=1)) +labs(title="S Nucleotide Diversity plot",x ="Nucleotide_position", y = "Score")+   geom_line(color="red")+ylim(0,150)
options(repr.p.width = 1, repr.p.height = 0.75)
p

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:



Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
